        <h3>This is what i have learnt so far since i began my Stutern cohort 1.4 training</h3>
        <p>
            HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) 
            are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides 
            the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, 
            for a variety of devices.
             Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are the basis 
             of building Web pages and Web Applications.
        </p>
        <h4>Importance of CSS</h4>
        <p>
          CSS is what makes the webpage a lot more presentable especially with
          the introduction of semantics for HTML5 and CSS3 for better alignment and display. CSS is important for
          a number of reasons. Some of them are listed below:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Faster Page Speed</b> More code means slower page speed. 
            And CSS enables you to use less code. 
            CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply 
            it to all occurrences of a certain tag 
            within an HTML document.</li>
            <li><b>Better User Experience</b>CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, 
                it also allows 
                for user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in logical places 
                and well organized, user experience improves.</li>
                <li><b>Quicker Development Time</b>With CSS, you can apply specific formatting 
                    rules and styles to multiple pages with one string of code. One cascading 
                    style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance, 
                    you have product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and feel, 
                    writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of that same type.</li>  
                    
                    <li><b>Easy Formatting Changes</b>If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages, 
                        it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no need to fix every individual page. 
                        Just edit the corresponding CSS 
                        stylesheet and you’ll see changes applied to all the pages that are using that style sheet.</li> 
                        <li><b>Compatibility Across Devices</b>Responsive web design matters. In today’s day and age, 
                            web pages must be fully visible and easily navigable on all devices. 
                            Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, or even smart TV, CSS combines with HTML
                             to make responsive design possible.</li>

        <h3>The differences between paddings, borders and margins</h3>
        <div>
          <p>
            <span>Paddings: </span>Padding is used to create space around an 
            element's content, inside of any defined borders. This is the space
            <span id="emph">between the element and the border.</span> It can be written
            as <code>padding: 100px;</code> meaning top, bottom, left and right
            padding around the element will be 100px. We could also use
            <code>padding: 30px 40px;</code> to indicate that top and bottom
            padding will be 30px and left and right padding will be 40px.
            Another way to write it to specifiy the top, left and right and
            bottom is to use <code>padding: 0px 20px 5px;</code> to indicate
            that top will be 0px, left and right will be 20px and bottom will
            be 5px. Specifying the four dimensions you can use
            <code>padding: 20px 15px 10px 8px;</code> indicating that top should
            have a size of 20px, right should have a size of 15px, bottom should
            have a size of 10px and left should have a size of 8px. 
            <p> 
                Note that you can also specify only a dimension of the element such as padding right, padding top, padding bottom and padding left. For example: <code>padding left: 20px;</code> which indicates that the left side should have a padding of 20px. 
            </p>

          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Border: </span>This creates a border <span id="emph">between the padding and the margin of an element.</span> It has different CSS properties such as size, radius, style and color. It can be written as <code>border: 1px solid black; </code> to specify the border size as 1px, the border style as solid and the border color as black. To read more about CSS border properties. See <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp"> CSS Borders. </a>
          </p>

          <p>
            <span>Margin: </span>This is the space you create <span id="emph">outside any defined border of an element.</span> For example to give an element a margin of 50px, it can be written
            as <code>margin: 50px;</code> meaning top, bottom, left and right
            padding around the border of an element will be 50px. We could also use
            <code>margin: 10px 20px;</code> to indicate that top and bottom
            margin will be 10px and left and right margin will be 20px.
            Another way to write it to specifiy the top, left and right and
            bottom is to use <code>margin: 10px 20px 5px;</code> to indicate
            that top will be 10px, left and right will be 20px and bottom will
            be 5px. Specifying the four dimensions you can use
            <code>margin: 20px 15px 10px 8px;</code> indicating that top should
            have a size of 20px, right should have a size of 15px, bottom should
            have a size of 10px and left should have a size of 8px. 
            <p>
                Note that you can also specify only a dimension of the element such as margin right, margin top, margin bottom and margin left. For example: <code>margin left: 20px;</code> which indicates that the left side should have a padding of 20px.
