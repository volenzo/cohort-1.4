      <h3>Clara Volenzo</h3>
      <p>
        Technology is a passion of mine and I enjoy nothing more than learning
        the trends that technology is taking in order to work more efficiently
        and see progress and success. I love seeing the big picture mapped out
        for technology needs. Whether its cloud services, or the future needs of
        a departmentâ€™s wireless technology. Efficiency is huge to me, and I have
        a passion for finding new and more productive ways to reach goals.
        Mapping out the technological solutions for the future is an important
        way to ensure efficiency is reached in every process possible.

      <h3>What i have learnt so far</h3>
      <p>
        HTML (the Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
        are two of the core technologies for building Web pages. HTML provides
        the structure of the page, CSS the (visual and aural) layout, for a
        variety of devices. Along with graphics and scripting, HTML and CSS are
        the basis of building Web pages and Web Applications.
      </p>
      <h4>Importance of CSS</h4>
      <p>
        CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets CSS describes how HTML elements
        are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media CSS saves a lot
        of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
        External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

          you to use less code. CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it

      <h3>Differences between paddings, margins and borders</h3>
      <p>
        <span>Margins:</span> The CSS margin properties are used to create space
        around elements, outside of any defined borders. With CSS, you have full
        control over the margins. There are properties for setting the margin
        for each side of an element (top, right, bottom, and left)
